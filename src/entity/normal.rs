/// A normal on a workplane or free in 3d.
///
/// In SolveSpace, "normals" represent a 3x3 rotation matrix from our base coordinate
/// system to a new frame, defined by the unit quaternion `[w, x, y, z]` where the quaternion
/// is given by `w + x*i + y*j + z*k`.
///
/// It is useful to think of this quaternion as representing a plane through the origin.
/// This plane has three associated vectors: basis vectors `U`, `V` that lie within the
/// plane, and normal `N` that is perpendicular to it.
///
/// Convenience functions are provided to convert between this representation as
/// vectors `U`, `V`, `N` and the unit quaternion.
///
/// A unit quaternion has only 3 degrees of freedom, but is specified in terms of
/// 4 parameters. An extra constraint is therefore generated implicitly, so that
/// `w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1`
/// See the [module-level documentation][crate] for usage example.
