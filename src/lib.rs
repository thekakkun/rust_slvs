/*!
This crate is a wrapper around the [SolveSpace](https://solvespace.com/index.pl)
geometic constraint solver library.

Sketch geometries by creating [entities][crate::entity] within the system,
then add [constraints][crate::constraint] to define relationships between multiple
entities.

Entities and constraints are referenced by their handles ([`EntityHandle`][crate::entity::EntityHandle]
and [`ConstraintHandle`][crate::constraint::ConstraintHandle], respectively). These are wrappers around
`u32` values with a phantom type used to ensure that entity and constraint definitions
are correctly referencing the expected type of entity.

# Examples

An example of a constraint in 2d. In our first group, we create a workplane
along the reference frame's xy plane. In a second group, we create some
entities in that group and dimension them.

```
use slvs::{
    constraint::{Diameter, EqualRadius, PtLineDistance, PtPtDistance, Vertical},
    entity::{ArcOfCircle, Circle, Distance, LineSegment, Normal, Point, Workplane},
    utils::make_quaternion,
    system::{FailReason, SolveResult},
    System,
};

// Initialize the system and create a group for the canvas.
let mut sys = System::new();
let g1 = sys.add_group();

// First, we create our workplane. Its origin corresponds to the origin
// of our base frame (x y z) = (0 0 0)
let origin = sys
    .sketch(Point::new_in_3d(g1, [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]))
    .expect("origin point created");

// and it is parallel to the xy plane, so it has basis vectors (1 0 0)
// and (0 1 0).
let normal = sys
    .sketch(Normal::new_in_3d(
        g1,
        make_quaternion([1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]),
    ))
    .expect("normal created");
let workplane = sys
    .sketch(Workplane::new(g1, origin, normal))
    .expect("workplane created");

// Now create a second group. We'll solve group 2, while leaving group 1
// constant; so the workplane that we've created will be locked down,
// and the solver can't move it.
let g2 = sys.add_group();

// These points are represented by their coordinates (u v) within the
// workplane, so they need only two parameters each.
let p1 = sys
    .sketch(Point::new_on_workplane(g2, workplane, [10.0, 20.0]))
    .expect("point in 2d created");
let p2 = sys
    .sketch(Point::new_on_workplane(g2, workplane, [20.0, 10.0]))
    .expect("point in 2d created");
// And we create a line segment with those endpoints.
let line = sys
    .sketch(LineSegment::new(g2, p1, p2))
    .expect("line segment created");

// Now three more points.
let arc_center = sys
    .sketch(Point::new_on_workplane(g2, workplane, [100.0, 120.0]))
    .expect("point in 2d created");
let arc_start = sys
    .sketch(Point::new_on_workplane(g2, workplane, [120.0, 110.0]))
    .expect("point in 2d created");
let arc_end = sys
    .sketch(Point::new_on_workplane(g2, workplane, [115.0, 115.0]))
    .expect("point in 2d created");
// And arc, centered at point arc_center, starting at point arc_start, ending at
// point arc_finish.
let arc = sys
    .sketch(ArcOfCircle::new(
        g2, workplane, arc_center, arc_start, arc_end,
    ))
    .expect("arc created");

// Now one more point, and a distance
let circle_center = sys
    .sketch(Point::new_on_workplane(g2, workplane, [200.0, 200.0]))
    .expect("point in 2d created");
let circle_radius = sys
    .sketch(Distance::new(g2, 30.0))
    .expect("distance created");
// And a complete circle, centered at point circle_center with radius equal to
// distance circle_radius. Creating a normal on the workplane lets the system
// know that the cirle lies on the workplane, not just parallel to it.
let workplane_normal = sys
    .sketch(Normal::new_on_workplane(g2, workplane))
    .expect("2d normal created");
let circle = sys
    .sketch(Circle::new(
        g2,
        workplane_normal,
        circle_center,
        circle_radius,
    ))
    .expect("circle created");

// The length of our line segment is 30.0 units.
sys.constrain(PtPtDistance::new(g2, p1, p2, 30.0, Some(workplane)))
    .expect("constrain line segment to 30.0 units");
// And the distance from our line segment to the origin is 10.0 units.
sys.constrain(PtLineDistance::new(g2, origin, line, 10.0, Some(workplane)))
    .expect("distance from line to origin is 10.0");
// And the line segment is vertical.
sys.constrain(Vertical::from_line(g2, workplane, line))
    .expect("line segment is vertical");
// And the distance from one endpoint to the origin is 15.0 units.
sys.constrain(PtPtDistance::new(g2, p1, origin, 15.0, Some(workplane)))
    .expect("distance from p1 to origin is 15.0 units");
// And same for the other endpoint; so if you add this constraint then
// the sketch is overconstrained and will signal an error.
// sys.constrain(PtPtDistance::new(g2, p2, origin, 18.0, Some(workplane)))
//     .expect("distance from p2 to origin is 18.0 units");

// The arc and the circle have equal radius.
sys.constrain(EqualRadius::new_arc_and_circle(g2, arc, circle))
    .expect("arc and circle have equal radius");
// The arc has radius 17.0 units.
sys.constrain(Diameter::new_arc(g2, arc, 17.0 * 2.0))
    .expect("arc has diameter of 17.0 units");

// And solve.
